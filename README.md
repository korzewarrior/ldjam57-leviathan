# Leviathan

**A simple yet intense web game made for Ludum Dare 57.**

Descend into the deep as you pilot a fragile submarine away from a colossal Leviathan. Dodge treacherous underwater obstacles using only your mouse to survive the ocean’s crushing pressure — and the beast that follows.

Inspired by classics like *Flappy Bird*, but with a downward, mouse-driven twist.
