# Leviathan

![banner.png](///raw/94d/71/z/6aa48.png)

Plunge into the abyssal depths where sunlight fears to tread. Pilot your fragile vessel deeper and deeper into the crushing darkness, guided only by echoes of something immense, something ancient. The pressure mounts, resources dwindle, and the shadows writhe with unseen terrors.

You are hunted. A relentless presence descends from above, a colossal shadow chasing you down into the unknown. Push deeper, faster, using your wits and limited boost to stay ahead. Every meter gained is a desperate victory against the crushing weight of the ocean and the inevitable pursuit.

What secrets lie hidden in the crushing black? What price must be paid to escape the abyss? Face the vast, somber terror that hunts you and discover the chilling truth lurking in the heart of the ocean.

## Notes

*   Atmosphere and the feeling of pressure are key components of the experience. Good luck!

## Development Notes

*   **Time Spent:** Roughly 45 hours over the jam weekend.
*   **Tech:** Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Kept it simple to focus on the core mechanic and atmosphere within the time limit. No engines or complex libraries.
*   **Thoughts:** The core idea was to invert the usual 'climbing' escape and make it about descending away from a threat above. Getting the feel of the controls and the pressure of the chase was the main focus. Balancing the boost and the Leviathan's speed took a bit of iteration. Hope you enjoy the dive!
